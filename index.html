          <h2>What is the brain made of?</h2>
          <p>
            The brain consists most obviously of gray matter and white matter, brain tissue and its interconnections or bundles of axons. Look more closely at the former and one can distinguish neurons and glia (the other kind of brain cell).

          <p>
            A big part of understanding the brainâ€™s parts list is so researchers can better understand which cells in the brain might underlie neurological and psychiatric diseases. Many neuropsychiatric disorders do not affect the entire brain uniformly, but rather start in or are driven by specific classes of neurons or other brain cells.

          <h2>What will it mean to understand our brains?</h2>
          <p>
            When we think about understanding something, we often think about being able to explain it in a relatively simple way. In science, researchers in other fields look to physics as a model of understanding, said Koch, who is himself a former physicist. The physical world lends itself to abstractions that can be boiled down to (relatively) simple equations.
